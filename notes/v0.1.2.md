# 0.1.2 Minor Updates

In this release we have:

  - Fixed some bugs related to variable scopes and variable sharing.
  - Added support for some new image-related ops, under the namespace
    `tf.image`.
  - Improved consistency for the creation of initializer ops.
  - Added support for the `tf.initializer` op creation context.
  - Improvements to the learn API:
    - Removed the layer creation context mechanism, to be refactored
      later. It was causing some issues due to bad design and unclear
      semantics. The plan is to implement this, in the near future, as
      wrapper creation context layers.
    - Improved the `Model` class.
    - Fixed a bug that was causing some issues related to inference
      hooks in the in-memory estimator.
    - Improved logging.
