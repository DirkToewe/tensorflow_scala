# 0.3.0 Static Data Types and More

With this release we have finally added support for static data type
information for tensors (not for symbolic tensors -- i.e., `Output`s -- yet).
This is an important milestone and contributes significantly to type safety,
which can help catch errors at compile time, rather than runtime. For example,

```scala
val t1 = Tensor(0.5, 1) // The inferred type is Tensor[FLOAT64]
val t2 = Tensor(1, 2)   // The inferred type is Tensor[INT32]
val t3 = t1 + t2        // The inferred type is Tensor[FLOAT64]
val t4 = t3.isNaN       // The inferred type is Tensor[BOOLEAN]
val t5 = t3.any()       // Fails at compile-time because `any()` is only supported for Tensor[BOOLEAN]
```

Other new features include:

- Improvements to the high-level learn API
  (e.g., layers now support `.map(...)`).
